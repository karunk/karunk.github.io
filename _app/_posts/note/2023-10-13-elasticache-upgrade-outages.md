# Updating Sidekiq Redis Instances in Production

## Why do we need to update the instances
You can create empty topics, or choose a template for different types of content that contains some boilerplate structure to help you get started:

## What happens if we simply click update
%product% supports two types of markup: Markdown and XML.
When you create a new help article, you can choose between two topic types, but this doesn't mean you have to stick to a single format.
You can author content in Markdown and extend it with semantic attributes or inject entire XML elements.

## Why is it not ok for Sidekiq to loose jobs?
For example, this is how you inject a procedure:

### Sidekiq Pro Features - How it helps

## Possible Approaches
To add switchable content, you can make use of tabs (inject them by starting to type `tab` on a new line):

### Sync Processing and Updating Sidekiq
Apart from injecting entire XML elements, you can use attributes to configure the behavior of certain elements.
For example, you can collapse a chapter that contains non-essential information:

### Creating a new Sidekiq instance and draining old one
Content under a collapsible header will be collapsed by default,
but you can modify the behavior by adding the following attribute:
`default-state="expanded"`

## Overhead for each update
If you need to extend an element with more functions, you can convert selected content from Markdown to semantic markup.
For example, if you want to merge cells in a table, it's much easier to convert it to XML than do this in Markdown.
Position the caret anywhere in the table and press <shortcut>Alt+Enter</shortcut>:
